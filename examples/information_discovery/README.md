# Information Discovery Examples

This folder contains example JSON structures for the Information Discovery scenario in the Decentralized Skilling and Education Protocol (DSEP). These examples illustrate how the protocol handles various aspects of discovering and consuming advisory content, particularly in an agricultural context.

## Files in this folder

1. `discovery_example.json`: Demonstrates the process of searching for and discovering relevant advisory content.
2. `consumption_example.json`: Shows the consumption of advisory content (e.g., watching a video) and available post-consumption options.
3. `support_example.json`: Illustrates the process of accessing support after consuming content.
4. `feedback_example.json`: Represents the process of providing ratings and feedback for consumed content.

## Use Case

These examples are based on the following use case:

A farmer (Moti) in Odisha is facing Aphid infestation in her wheat crop. A farm extension worker (Ramesh) uses a DSEP-enabled application to search for solutions. They find and watch a video about controlling Aphid infestations, then connect with support for further assistance. Finally, they provide a rating and feedback for the video.

## JSON Structure

Each JSON file in this folder represents a different stage in the user journey:

1. Discovery: Searching for and finding relevant content
2. Consumption: Viewing or using the discovered content
3. Support: Accessing additional help or information
4. Feedback: Rating the content and providing comments

These structures are designed to be flexible and can be adapted to various types of advisory content beyond the agricultural example provided.

## Integration with DSEP

These examples demonstrate how the Decentralized Skilling and Education Protocol can be applied to scenarios involving the discovery and consumption of byte-sized advisory content. They show how DSEP can facilitate:

- Efficient content discovery based on user needs
- Seamless content consumption
- Easy access to additional support
- Collection of user feedback for continuous improvement

## Usage

Developers and implementers can use these JSON structures as references when building applications that interact with the DSEP network for information discovery and consumption scenarios.

Please note that these are example structures and may need to be adjusted based on specific implementation requirements or future updates to the DSEP specification.
